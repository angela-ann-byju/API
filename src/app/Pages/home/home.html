  <h1>Welcome to the Product Showcase</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    This application is designed to demonstrate how Angular works with
    real-time APIs in a practical and easy-to-understand manner. All the
    product information displayed in this project is fetched live from the
    DummyJSON API using Angular’s HttpClient service. By using a real API,
    this project shows how data is requested from a server, processed inside
    a service, and then displayed dynamically in the user interface without
    refreshing the page. This approach reflects how modern web applications
    handle data efficiently and provide a smooth user experience.

  <p class="intro">
    The Product Showcase allows users to browse through multiple products,
    view images, prices, and descriptions, and navigate between different
    sections of the application using Angular Router. Each product has its
    own detailed view page, which is loaded using route parameters.
  </p>

  <p class="intro">
    Overall, this project serves as a learning example for understanding
    core Angular concepts including component-based architecture, API
    integration, routing, and basic styling. It is suitable for beginners
    who want to build a real-world Angular application and gain hands-on
    experience in developing a single-page application with dynamic data.
